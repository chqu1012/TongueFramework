# TongueFramework
It is just another javafx renderer with several missed features. This renderer editor support is only used in Eclipse, but the core part can binded independently outside from eclipse.

Included Features:
* Generation of Model View Control classes
* List of fs id class generation
* Directly use of JavaFX controls indeed of reflections (in comparision to fxml)
* Databinding modelling in the tongue file
* Validations based on regular expressions

## How it works
A tongue file describes how the user interface looks like and in the code behind class (controller) the event listener methods can defined as in fxml.
